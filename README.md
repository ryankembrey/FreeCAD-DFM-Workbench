# FreeCAD DFM Workbench
A powerful, extensible Design for Manufacturability (DFM) workbench for
FreeCAD. This workbench analyses 3D models and provides actionable feedback to
help designers create parts that are cheaper, faster, and more reliable to
manufacture.

Currently under heavy development as part of a university capstone project.
